They hit a New York first, but I grew up in North Carolina. I moved here almost three years ago and yeah, it's been cool to learn about different cultures and parts of the world because the South doesn't have good education. You're told. I'm from the U.S. and my parents are as well, but I did visit Sweden over the summer and I was there for midsummer and that was a really cool time to be able to witness a really important cultural tradition and be a part of it and learn. Yeah. Woohoo! Bye.",
