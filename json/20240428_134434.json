        "response_text": "Last year I was living in Japan for the summer. I was studying out there in the University of Tsukuba and it was a very unique experience. It's a very different culture. I didn't really speak the language and I really enjoyed kind of meeting new people and getting to know the culture more, though the experience of being an immigrant was very difficult, I guess, you know, just feeling so disconnected and missing my home country and my family and not being able to communicate with other people to kind of acclimate as well as I would like. So it was a great experience, but I can see how it could be really difficult for many, many people.",
