I've been here for 14 years.\nHowever, I just never thought I would be living in the Swedish neighborhood.\nBut it's my favorite neighborhood.\nAnd I'm really proud of that part of my heritage.\nIt's just such rich culture and Swedish people in general are just very nice, caring people.\nAnd I'm very grateful to be living in this neighborhood.\nAnd this is my first time at the Swedish Museum. I should have done this a long time ago.\nSo yeah, this is why I came here and I've been here ever since.\nI've been doing this.\nAnd I've been trying to figure out the centre of Chicago and the heritage table.\nSo I came here and said to myself to Ariego-Riviange,\nAnd it has many many things.\nYou see undercuting onto that territory.\nI'm looking at the center of Chicago.",
