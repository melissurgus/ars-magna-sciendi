        "response_text": "Hello. I came to the U.S. from Pakistan in 2013 because of my dad's job, so I was only here temporarily.\nBut then in high school, I met my wife, and I fell in love.\nAnd since then, I've been here. The process of immigrating was difficult for like two years.\nI couldn't see my parents, but now that I have the green card, it's allowed me to appreciate a lot more\nof the different aspects of the American life, like just the fact that this museum is here.\nAcross the street, they're selling tacos, and there's a Korean restaurant a block down.\nThat, I think, really is the strength of the U.S., and it's been great seeing all these exhibitions.\nThank you for listening.",
