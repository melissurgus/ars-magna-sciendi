Never really been outside of the state that much, so when I drove over here, you know, I got to see the states along the way, which was very cool, kind of eye-opening. But let's see, a special object. My family has like a, what do you know, like a family tree book that goes all the way back to like 1500, supposedly, assuming it's all legit. Yeah, that's the only thing I could really think of. Yeah, it goes back to like 1500 or whatever. And yeah, Korean American. My uncle is a Swedish American. Lived with him for a few years, so that's pretty much why I'm here. But yeah, it's pretty neat. It would be cool to see Sweden someday.",
