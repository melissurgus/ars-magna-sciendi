        "response_text": "My name is Aidan. I'm probably moving to Sweden next year for school. But the other thing that inspired my move is a longtime friend that I've had on the internet. His name is Philip. I've known him since we were both 15. And he always seemed like something kind of out of reach. More a dream than anything. Things kind of went south for me this last year, and he finally offered to become kind of more than just fancy. So I'm realizing a little too late that he's probably the love of my life, and I should have said more sooner because now he's, you know, probably going to stay in the closet because he saw a girl or something. It's bad timing. But I'm going out there, whether that works out or not. I'm very excited. I think it's a beautiful language, a beautiful country. Yeah, pray for me.",
