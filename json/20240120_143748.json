        "response_text": "Hi, my name is Layla and my special object in my family related to our heritage is this really big spoon my mom gave me when I first moved to Chicago for school. My family is originally from Kenya and a meal that I grew up on is skumaliki and ugali. And how you make ugali is you get cornmeal, you boil some water and you cook it with a big giant spoon. And right before I left I got really into making Kenyan food and my mom gifted me this spoon that she had that she was using to make ugali for us as a way for me to do it when I'm on my own and I can make it for myself and it's been really nice because I've been able to make it for myself and for people that I love and I'm excited to pass it down to my future children when I teach them how to make Kenyan dishes. So yeah that's my favorite special object from my family.",
