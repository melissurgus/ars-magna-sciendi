        "response_text": "My name is Daniel and I'm from the UK. When I was 30 years old I moved from the UK to Brussels in Belgium in order to start working as an interpreter for the EU. Brussels is a place with lots of different cultures and languages so it was kind of exciting but it's still different from my homeland even though it's not very far away. So I've lived in Brussels for the last 20 years and I got used to living in a mix, a real melting pot, a little bit like Washington DC in the United States, a place where lots of different people come together from different parts of Europe. But still I need to go back to my homeland from time to time just to be in touch with family and friends and with my roots.",
